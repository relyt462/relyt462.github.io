This is a blog where I talk about game design and development as a programmer from outside the games industry. I am currently getting my bachelors in computer science.
You can find examples of my work on [github](https://github.com/relyt462/) and you can find my previous ludum dare entries on my [ludum dare page](http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/relyt462/) (which will hopefully have more on it in the future).
If you want to contact me use my email - relyt462@gmail.com
