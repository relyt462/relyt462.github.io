Hey all and welcome,

I decided to open up this blog with a simple welcome post describing what I intend to primarily use it for. This blog is going to be used for documenting my experiences with game design and development along with tutorials on open source projects I release or intend to release. There are going to be two series to begin with: a tutorial for building a 2d game engine using sdl2 and c++, and a series on my experiences and thoughts on tabletop rpg design following the development of a game I am currently developing.
